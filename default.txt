It seems that the divisions are caused by two major coalitions, the Freedom Fight Against Dog Leashes and the Victims For Dog Attack Justice League. It all started when a lady by the name of Edith was walking down the street, when all of a sudden, a door-to-door salesman approaches her and explains the benefits of SuperEars, a hearing aid company. They have that perfect in-the-ear canal design she was told. Well, because she couldn’t say no to nobody, she spends several thousand on a pair of hearing aids. After she was done with business, she walks across the street to the dry cleaners where she picks up her load of laundry. It is at this moment that a wild chihuahua runs up to her and bits her leg. She screams in agony. Later that day, she told her husband about the incident, and he called his legal team, Rabinowitz, Rabinowitz, and Rabinowitz. They inform him that they will take the case up to the Super-Duper Court of All Courts. Unfortunately for the old lady, she lost the landmark case, prompting national outrage. Soon, both sides started recruiting militaries of dogs to fight each other and show whether leashes are really needed or not. What do you do? "
